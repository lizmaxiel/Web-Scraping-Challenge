# Web-Scrapping-Challenge

For this assignmnet I applied knowledge of identifying HTML elements, extracting information, and working with automated browsing. We use this information to extract valuable data. 

The main objectives are divided into two deliverables:
  1. Scrape Titles and Preview text from Mars new articles
      The first task was to scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles. This was done by identifying and extracting specific elements from the web page containing Mars-related news.
  2. Scrape and Analyze Mars weather data
       For this second part, I scraped and analyzed Mars weather data presented in tabular format. This required both data extraction and basic data analysis techniques to gain insights from weather data.
